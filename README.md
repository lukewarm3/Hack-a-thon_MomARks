Swift+SwiftUI+Google ARCore API+Firebase

The reference ARCore code in our project:
https://github.com/google-ar/arcore-ios-sdk.git

MomARks uses ARCore API and SwiftUI to bring social media into the real world. Users leave and discover virtual “moments”—messages and memories anchored to physical places.
You can use it to:
1. Navigate around on an interactive map view
2. Geolocate tagged posts
3. Post virtual post with descriptionand image
4. View others virtual posts
